# Discord-Bot
A Discord C#/.NET Bot 

This Discord bot is a chat and voice coded in C#. This bot currently is still in development, and will be sourced for public use towards the beginning of January 2018.

This bot is built to be run on any .NET Framework compatible machine. It is meant for single server usage due to the heavy amount of resouces the voice part consumes.

This bot was built specifically for a single Mobile Game, Unison League, but is being expanded for a more general use.
